# GEOFENCING APPLICATION

## ABOUT 
By using this application, whenever the user navigates to or from the geofencing location the user is notified by a push notification

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
	Design Pattern : MVVM(Basic Architecture)
	Language       : Kotlin
	Google APIs    : GoogleMaps, GeoFencing, Firebase Crashlytics
	Others         : ViewBinding
	
## TECHNOLOGY AND MODULE NOTE
This Application includes:
* View
* ViewModel
* Engine
* Push Notifications
### View
 The View is nothing but, its an User Interface
* Maps
> Google Map is used to Show the user Current location and also find where the GeoFence location is pointed
 
 ### ViewModel
 >In MVVM design pattern, ViewModel is a class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for an Activity or a Fragment, also to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. 
 
 ### Engine
 Engine is used to create and manage the GeoFence
 * GeoFence
 >A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area. A geo-fence could be dynamically generatedâ€”as in a radius around a point location, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries
 
 * GeoFenceReciver
 >It is used to recive wether the user is entered or exited from the location. It will be show the notification to the User

 * When the user location is enabled, the map shows the exact current location of the user.

  * Whenever the user taps on any location, the user can enable the GeoFencing location for that tapped location in the map.
  * While tapping a location, the location is surrounded with radius of certain distance, it can be increased or decreased manually.
  * After selecting the location and then enable button is clicked.Now the geoFencing for that location is enabled

 * Now whenever the user navigates through that geofenced location i.e., the user may enter or exit that location, the user is notified with a popup notification.
